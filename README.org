*** architecture

i use org files as astro pages and components, in that way i can use the built-in astro support for markdown which is pretty good (eg. easy config to set a default layout for every page).

here is the current flow:

emacs' org-mode (accessed with iSH on iPad) →
git commit →
vercel automatic build and deploy →
prepare vercel environment with a shell script (simulating a Dockerfile) →
convert all .org files to .md using pandoc with a shell script →
astro →
fair css styles by default with unocss's prose
