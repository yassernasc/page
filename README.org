*** architecture

i use org files as astro pages and components converting them to markdown on build time, in that way i can use the built-in astro support for markdown content which is pretty good.

here is the current flow:

1. emacs' org-mode (accessed with iSH on iPad)
2. git commit
3. vercel automatic build and deploy
4. prepare vercel environment with a shell script (simulating a Dockerfile)
5. convert all .org files to .md using pandoc with a shell script
6. normal astro usage
7. fair styles by default with unocss' prose
