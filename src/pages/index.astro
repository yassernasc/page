    <p>
      I have profissional experience with <i
        >TypeScript Full-Stack development</i
      >, mostly working with Angular, React and Node.js. More details can be
      found on <a href="https://read.cv/yassernasc">my CV</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've quit my job and now I'm taking a sabbatical, on that period I took
      some weeks to rest my tired mind and then started to refresh my skills, I
      learned a new programming language: <b>Golang</b>; Dived into <b
        >Flutter</b
      > for mobile development; now I use Emacs for writing and as a bonus I maintain
      a home server running Arch Linux (yes, I know).
    </p>

    <p>
      While I'm still working on some personal projects and experiments, I'm
      also totally open for a chat, <a href="https://cal.com/yassernasc/chat"
        >schedule a meeting</a
      >; Or simply <a href="maito:dev@yasser.email">email me</a>, I truly enjoy
      both approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current English level: I know how to write Environment, Thought and Length
      without googling any, that's dope, right?
