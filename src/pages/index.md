I have profissional experience with *TypeScript Full-Stack development*, mostly working with Angular, React and Node.js. More details can be found on [my CV](https://read.cv/yassernasc).

I've quit my job and now I'm taking a sabbatical, on that period I took some weeks to rest my tired mind and then started to refresh my skills, I learned a new programming language: *Golang*; Dived into *Flutter* for mobile development; now I use Emacs for writing and as a bonus I maintain a home server running Arch Linux (yes, I know).

While I'm still working on some personal projects and experiments, I'm also totally open for a chat, [schedule a meeting](https://cal.com/yassernasc/chat); Or simply [email me](maito:dev@yasser.email), I truly enjoy both approaches.

Current English level: I know how to write Environment, Thought and Length without googling any, that's dope, right?
