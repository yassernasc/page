# About me

![Yasser profile image](/profile.jpg "Yasser profile image")

Hi, I am writing from Brazil.

I find presenting myself as a hard task, and sometimes I fall into thoughts about not being a very interesting person, but here we go.

### Now a list of things I like:

- write and read code

- privacy tools, p2p, distributed networks

- unix and open source culture

- read books and articles, technical and not

- indie games like celeste

- leftists ideas (not radically (yet))

- watch movies, those melancholic or terrifying are my favorite

- weird music like boogarins - erre and slowdive - miranda

### And now a list of ideas that I would like to try:

- having a blog

- maintaining a home server and embrace self-hosting

- understand networking, tcp/ip, and use advanced tools like nmap

- learn and use esoteric? programming languages like haskell

- be part of great online communities

- cultivate a respectful dotfiles

- visit the São Januário stadium


If you want to talk to me about any of those subjects, please check out the [contact](/contact) or [connect](/connect) folder and go ahead, let's have a nice time.
