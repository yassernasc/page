#+title: hire me

I have profissional experience with /TypeScript Full-Stack development/, mostly working with Angular, React and Node.js.

I'm available to both part-time and full-time opportunities.

I enjoy to work from home, I'm currently in UTC-3 time zone (similar to US time zone).

Current English level: I know how to write Environment, Thought and Length without googling any, that's dope, right?
