I have profissional experience with /TypeScript Full-Stack development/, mostly working with Angular, React and Node.js. More details can be found on [[https://read.cv/yassernasc][my CV]].

I've quit my job and now I'm taking a sabbatical, on that period I took some weeks to rest my tired mind and then started to refresh my skills, I learned a new programming language: /Golang/; Dived into /Flutter/ for mobile development; now I use Emacs for writing and as a bonus I maintain a home server running Arch Linux (yes, I know).

While I'm still working on some personal projects and experiments, I'm also totally open for a chat, [[https://cal.com/yassernasc/chat][schedule a meeting]]; Or simply [[maito:dev@yasser.email][email me]], I truly enjoy both approaches.

Current English level: I know how to write Environment, Thought and Length without googling any, that's dope, right?
